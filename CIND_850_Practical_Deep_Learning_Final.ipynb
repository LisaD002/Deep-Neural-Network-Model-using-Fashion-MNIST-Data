I began contacting WFB whom my home loan is with, for assitance and options. \\nIn early XX/XX/XXXX I began the Loan Modification process with Wells Fargo Bank. I was told that they would not assist me with anything financial on my home loan until I fell 90 days behind, though at the time I started to inquire for assistance from WFB I was only a few weeks behind. So, I began working with a program called XXXX. They approved me for a variety of assistence and reached out to Wells Fargo Bank to determine what they could assist with. Wells Fargo then turned down the assistance from XXXX and finally offered to do a Loan Modification for me. The outcome was totally unknow about what I would be offered in the end by WFB for assistance. Wells Fargo lost my paperwork twice during this process, so it took 2 months from the time I started to the time my paperwork began to be processed for some kind of approval. In XX/XX/XXXX I was in a trial period of 3 months of payments based on a slightly modified amount. Roughly {$75.00} less than what I was paying on my original payment. However, my caseworker with WFB, failed to tell me that since the payments during this time were not the full amount of the original mortgage payment so they were not applied to the loan. I discovered this in XX/XX/XXXX when I was told by a creditor with XXXX that she could n't restore my line of credit because of something to do with my mortgage. I then called and found this out. My caseworker at WFB then told me it was n't her responsibility to tell me this information. I told her that she could have told me that if I could come up with the remaining amount of {$75.00} then the payments would be applied. Instead, she chose to withhold this information and damage my credit even further. Now we are into 5 months ( including the 90 days WFB told me I had to fall behind until they would help me ) without an applied payment to my home loan, going on 6 months. \\nMore paperwork was lost in XXXX as the modification was being finalized and my loan modification did n't go through until XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to a lawyer that is working on a class-action lawsuit against WFB for people in a similar situation and said this paper loss is typical. \\nWells Fargo did not reduce the interest rate, but they did reduce the payment by less than {$100.00} and the payments I was behind went back into the loan. \\nMy property taxes also fell behind in my escrow account at this time because there was no payment on the loan. So, I am behind on my property taxes, have damaged credit, and and I am not in any better payment situation than I was. \\nThey can not give me a reason on why they rejected XXXX assistance. I was originally told they were not an approved agency but on a later phone call to Wells Fargo Bank I was told that they work with that program often and the WFB employee could not understand why they would reject the help. I also spoke with XXXX and they said that Wells Fargo works with this program all the time and could n't understand why they would do this. \\nI feel that I have been taken advantage of by Wells Fargo and would like to pursue legal action against them based on negligence. \\nAlthough my payments are back on track I am not making much more money now than I was before so it is only a matter of time before something like this happens again if something unforeseen happens to my life that affects my finances. \\n\",\n",

Predatory lending has clearly been an everyday factor in order for the finance department to make a better commissions on the consumer who is not aware of how the process works.

When my attorney and I have requested that they update the payoff since it was not my error, they are not helping me. They have told me they have to wait for the refund from XXXX County. When I contacted XXXX County, they advised me they do not refund mortgage companies for issues such as this. They said the mortgage company has to request the funds from the owner of the property that they erroneously paid. Nationstar is now saying they did not make a mistake. My attorney has documentation showing the issue and that I am being penalized for this, which is making it impossible for me to refinance my loan to a lower interest rate ( this is how we noticed the issue ). I have spent literally hours trying to get this resolved - many times being disconnected and given incorrect call back numbers or numbers that route to the wrong department. I also gave each of the representatives my call back number and no one has called me back. I left several messages with XXXX in the tax department and she never returned my calls. I want to move my loan from this company ( which could be accomplished through a refi ), but they are showing me as owing {$6000.00} more than I should, which means I would have to come out of pocket and hope for a reimbursement at some point. \\n\",\n",

When I ask what they recommend I do, they say to not even bother sending the amount that I can actually afford without losing my home and car ( needed for my job ) because it 's not enough to do anything worthwhile.

She 's also still receiving letters and phone calls that that particular account is delinquent, even though she 's making payments on it. \\n\\nI am at my wits end with them, trying to contact them via paper ( I refuse to talk to them on the phone anymore, as it 's resulting in me having panic and anxiety attacks every time they call. ) I do n't want to go into default, but I ca n't afford anything close to what they are demanding for these loans. I have used up all of my forbearance time on these loans ( which I paid {$150.00} every few months to put them into when it was XXXX XXXX. ) It 's almost making me wish that I never went to school at all, and also wish that my school had done a better job educating about what private loans really are instead of having me just sign a piece of paper for more money towards tuition ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX of XXXX. ) My federal loans are in a reasonable repayment plan based on my income ... why ca n't private loans be the same way?

The problem is Bank of America is receiving my money that I work hard for applying to the account and saying there is n't a payment that was n't made because this came from the insurance company. The insurance was again in the event I was unable to pay my bill they would pay it. Although Bank of America no longer does business with this company. The insurance company refunded the consumers some of the money and it was either sent as a check. Bank of America takes my money and than says there is not payment it is a credit. Which cant be a credit because that was a payment made for a service that was never rendered. What Bank of America is doing is stealing. They are charge me a late fee for something that was n't late. Its no different if I have a friend pay my monthly bill. You cant say your applying that payment as credit because someone else paid and that charge me late payments.

I did not realize until it was too late that I had forgotten to change my banking information and the payment was rejected by my bank. ( I have since cleared this up. ) I called AES to discuss further options. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by a representative that I qualified for XXXX-day forbearance.

              "       'I live in California, my former mortgage holder, XXXX, went bankrupt and sold our loan to Green Tree. Prior to the sell, I had never heard of this company. As a result of the sell Green Tree opened an escrow account, to pay property taxes and insurance, I never had a escrow account before and do not believe the State of California requires lenders to maintain an escrow account. My mortgage is a fixed rate 30+ year mortgage and the monthly mortgage payment is {$1200.00} and I pay $ XXXX monthly to cover the escrow payment for property taxes and insurance. According to my monthly statement from Green Tree, my regular monthly payment is {$1500.00} so I pay roughly {$11.00} per month more than is required which I acknowledge was no designated to be applied to the escrow account until I recently made my XXXX payment. Despite my attempts to comply with the terms of this loan, every year since Green Tree has held our mortgage we get a bill for XXXX of dollars, this year it was {$800.00}, supposedly because of escrow shortages. Every year it \\'s a different amount, but the escrow shortages are always for XXXX of dollars and the amount of insurance and property taxes we pay annually does not increase that much to justify these increases of XXXX of dollars each year. Green Tree provides this annual escrow account disclosure statement with this convoluted calculation to justify these increases ( copy attached ). This year XXXX days prior to receiving the annual escrow account disclosure statement we received a letter from Green Tree stating that our account was current ( copy attached ). Each year I contact Green Tree to get someone to explain these calculations and I have yet to understand the justification or the explanation. If you do n\\'t pay the amount of the shortage Green Tree threatens to increase the amount of your regular monthly payment to cover the shortage. I find it hard to believe it is legal for a mortgage company to charge a borrower XXXX of dollars more per year to maintain an escrow account if it \\'s cheaper for the borrower to pay their own property taxes and insurance. If the borrower \\'s property taxes and insurance are not delinquent, then a borrower should be able to opt out of such a onerous escrow arrangement. If Green Tree is able to charge people XXXX of dollars more each year for these \" supposed escrow shortages \\'\\' it \\'s no wonder they require borrowers to have an escrow account. We should be able to pay our own property taxes and insurance to avoid the financial hardship that Green Tree is creating. We are currently stuck with this mortgage company, but at the first opportunity we will make every effort to change lenders. But I do n\\'t believe we should be penalized because we are stuck with this company. A company we did not voluntarily enter into a contract with. It should not be legal for a mortgage company to require consumers to have an escrow account that costs them hundreds of dollars more per year than it would cost if that consumer paid their own property taxes and insurance. I do n\\'t know if this practice is legal but it should n\\'t be and it definitely needs to be investigated. \\n',\n",

Neither my Realtor/Broker nor I was informed by Bank of America ( in XXXX through XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) that changes being made in the XXXX System would hinder the process until after the fact. Because of this, the documentation failed to be processed and I received a decline. Unfortunately, due to my Realtor/Broker \\'s Mother untimely passing, I elected to switch Brokers.

Unscrupulous salespersons contacted my mom many times to get her to refinance her house at a rate she could not afford and terms she could never repay. She purchased her home in XX/XX/XXXX for {$25000.00}, and houses in her area are currently appraised in the $ 55,000- {$75000.00} range. Mom finally relented and agreed to the refinance XX/XX/XXXX, 15 months after she had suffered a debilitating stroke, when she especially needed any extra money to offset healthcare costs. The loan amount was for {$180000.00} ( based on a grossly inflated appraisal ), and it appears Mom \\'s income was fabricated to qualify for the loan. It is an adjustable rate mortgage, with an above market start rate of 7.35 %, but it could ONLY go up because 7.35 % was also the floor for the mortgage. To make matters worse, the loan had a five percent pre-payment penalty during the first two years. The loan also had a 40 year amortization schedule, but was for a 30 year term, meaning that Mom would have a substantial balloon payment of over {$100000.00} due in XX/XX/XXXX, when she would be almost XXXX years old. Mom tells me that she contacted Wells Fargo on a number of occasions to seek a loan modification. Each time Mom says that her paperwork would be lost by Wells Fargo, or she says that additional documentation was requested ( even though Mom believes the documents were previously submitted, multiple times ). At one point, a representative told Mom that she was ineligible for a modification because her loan was current. When she finally fell behind, she says she was told that she was not eligible for a modification because her loan was in default. Mom says her multiple requests for a modification were never approved, yet she believes that she never received any kind of acceptable explanation as to the basis for the denial. At this point, she will very likely lose the home she has had retrofitted with a number of items that help Mom function more normally, such as pull up bars and other items that compensate for her XXXX and assist her with every day activities. My XXXX siblings and I were not aware of the situation until after the foreclosure occurred this past XXXX.

I told him I did n\\'t care about the security reason, I \\'m calling to inquire about the lack of notification regarding the hold on my line of credit. He kept telling me for security reasons it will take 7-10 business days and if I wait to Friday I can use the full credit amount.

When i contacted the mortgage company loancare to get a check sent from my escrow account they said they could not send funds because XXXX checks were already sent out.

This loan was not needed and I feel that I should not have to pay them anymore and should receive my money back. Seeing as I have 36,000 + in federal for a two year degree because of the school already.

So I refinanced into a predatory adjustable rate loan with an interest rate that could only adjust up. I needed the money to get the repairs done on the house -- -I was not able to get any type of settlement out of the insurance company for over a year. To make matters worse after I had started on the repairs I got hit by ANOTHER hurricane.

I bid on XXXX jobs in a row and lost the bid on each of them. I got nothing for nearly a year and all of my reserves were liquidated. In order to stay relevant and employed I had to start bidding lower on jobs. On more than one occasion I actually lost money on the job. I also had some customers who stiffed me after I completed work on their home. They knew my situation and assumed I could not afford to hire an Attorney to sue them. I was in tough financial shape. \\n\\nWhen I was not working and bleeding my reserves I was told by the agents at XXXX Bank that they would absolutely not consider helping me unless I was XXXX months delinquent on my loan. I tried calling in on more than XXXX occasion and all representatives parroted this talking point. Of course, I was not able to keep making the payment anyway and I fell behind on the loan.

              "       \"Dear CFPB Representaive ( s ) ; First, thank you for making the platform for delivery of complaints accessible via the internet, and for making it so user-friendly. \\nMy drama began approximately seven years ago when Ocwen Loan Servicing began servicing my home loan. Still recovering from the impact of XXXX XXXX and a direct strike from a XXXX born out of the storm, the Mortgage Crisis was beginning. Michigan XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and finally Ocwen, each, took over my home loan. \\nSomewhere in the process my loan was put into a 30-year fixed loan. That was the good news. \\nBut, despite my pleas to handle my property tax and hazard premium payment myself, Ocwen demanded escrowing the funds. My town - XXXX XXXX, LA - requires property tax payments at the beginning of the year instead of year-end, like most municipalities. Despite repeated letters to Ocwen, my property taxes began accruing interest and penalties, and finally, after many years of letter writing warning Ocwen about the potential problem, I discovered Ocwen had n't even been paying my property taxes at all. And, my home and property were sold at a Tax Sale. ( attachment ) Only last month, in XX/XX/XXXX, did I finally find a change to my escrow account on Ocwen 's webpage. The glaring and abrupt increase in my escrow account and the increase in my monthly mortgage payment were tell-tale signs something had changed for the worse. \\nAnd, to make matters worse, my home suffered a total loss from a fire on XX/XX/XXXX. A plug-in fragrance and night light device was the cause. \\nBut, already losing my home and most of my possessions to this fire, I was forced to continue arguing with Ocwen Loan Servicing about the Delinquent Tax Bills they had not paid, but they had escrowed my payments for over the years. In other words, they took my payments for XXXX XXXX, but Ocwen did n't pay the taxes. \\nThen, the last straw was laid upon my already stressed existence. Ocwen withheld proceeds from my Hazard Premium for over thirty days from receipt of my funds. Ocwen played game after game slowing the release of even one dollar to help me rebuild my home. Had it not been for an XXXX, we would have suffered nearly 90-days with nothing. Still today, I have to argue constantly with Ocwen to release funds for reconstruction. And with 92 % of the work complete, only 66 % of the funds have been released. Today is XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX. Nearly seven months and still Ocwen withholds funds. About three weeks ago, Ocwen Loss Department called me to inquire about my percentage of completion of construction from the fire. We agreed they should send an inspector right away. The inspector showed up last week, but she forgot to bring the paperwork. Three days later she emailed me requesting I print he email, sign the form, scan the document and email it back. Perhaps, not having experienced a total loss from fire, she did n't realize fires do n't leave one 's computers and printers functional. \\nLooking at the number of documents Ocwen required before release of XXXX penny of the Insurance proceeds, some docs requiring notorization then discarded by Ocwen as unimportant, one ca n't imagine the burdeon placed on victims by their mortgage companies. But, I 've never heard of a mortgage company being as heartless as Ocwen. I know the documents were useless because despite everything I returned, Ocwen asked for other documents which were n't even in the original packet of docs that needed to be completed. Ocwen just wanted to hold the funds, Recently, it was newsworthy that Ocwen 's CEO stepped down from his lofty perch. I used to think my problems with Ocwen were somewhat unique, but once the news broke I learned that Ocwen had been hurting many, many others. More \\n\",\n",
              "       \"I have a variety of disputes with the manner that Wells Fargo Home Mortgage and XXXX have handled the origination and servicing of my mortgage loan. \\n\\nHowever, I recently spoke with XXXX representatives at Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX to request an opportunity to apply for a HAMP loan or other loan modification options. \\n\\nI was told on XX/XX/XXXX that Wells Fargo would send me Form XXXX and a loan modification package to start the review process. After three weeks, I still have not received any documentation from Wells Fargo. \\n\\nThe company has notoriously sent information after previously scheduled foreclosures dates to prevent me from having a chance to respond within a reasonable time frame. \\n\\nA current foreclosure date is scheduled and the company will probably send the modification documents on the day before the sale date. It 's this type action that prevents me from reaching an amicable resolution with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. \\n\\nI requested a loan modification last summer ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and Wells Fargo said that I could not obtain a modification to stop the foreclosure that was 14 days away. The foreclosure specialists within the Home Preservation department said that I should have contacted the company prior to 30 days -- to stop the sale and to apply for a loan modification. The foreclosure was cancelled at the last minute, but Wells Fargo never sent any of the documents that were promised to begin the modification review. \\n\\nSince my last request, nothing has been done by Wells Fargo. \\n\\nWhat 's frustrating to me is that, I contacted Wells Fargo three weeks ago and indicated to several representatives that I wanted to save my home and that I did not want to hear that a month was needed to apply for a modification and to cancel the foreclosure sale, as any viable solutions were being considered. \\n\\nAt this point the I have not received any information from Wells Fargo and the sale has not been canceled. This is another tactic that the company uses to prevent homeowners from applying for government-sponsored loan programs. \\n\\nAdditionally, I have suffered from predatory lending abuses, as well as investor and servicer fraud. Some of the abuses that the CFPB will challenge later this year might not be available to me, and other homeowners in similar situations. \\n\\nMy loan was originated with appraisal fraud, as the closing documents clearly show that underwriter-requested conditions required closer sales comps. My home was brand new with plenty of sales within close proximity to my home, but the XXXX and XXXX sales comps were both XXXX miles away. \\n\\nSince my loan was sold, Wells Fargo has fraudulently created and recorded XXXX ( XXXX ) bogus mortgage assignments in an effort to correct the original documentation with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Each attempt to fix the botched mortgage assignment was worse than the previous, however there has been criminal attempts to affirm their standing without any effort to resolve our differences. \\n\\nI am seeking speedy resolutions to remedy this situation, and ask the CFPB to require Wells Fargo to cancel the currently scheduled foreclosure sale, as I did contact the company in a timely manner or to cancel the sale while I pursue other legal options to sue Wells Fargo Home Mortgage and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\n\",\n",

I wanted to ascertain that the credit decision on my application was made in conformance with an established credit review policy and not an arbitrary, capricious decision based on age or race discrimination. \\nThe last letter from American Express dated XX/XX/XXXX again failed to address my request for a copy of the company credit review policy that pertains to the period of time after an account has been cancelled that a new application may be favorably considered. I will accept the American Express decision to decline my application if the credit review policy indicates the period of time after an account has been cancelled is eleven years or more, since my account was cancelled ten years and ten months ago. The credit review process should be the same for all applicants regardless of age, race or religion and without providing a copy of the credit review policy it is impossible to ascertain that the policy is being uniformly and equitably applied. American Express in every letter indicated that a new application could be submitted at a later date but without indicating the period of time a new application could be submitted to receive favorable consideration the company may be using this as a method of surreptitious discrimination. \\n',\n",

I was told I would n't qualify for a modification until I was 4 to 6 months behind on my mortgage payments. Once I was finally accepted into a trial period I discovered my mortgage was not valid as it had been separated from the promissory note in order for BOA to securitize and sell it as well as capitalizing on the promissory note by selling and or securitizing to sell once or many times over.

Incidentally or additionally BOA owes me interest and money on all transactions that I made through BOA via checks written, credit card use and debt card use ( except for withdrawing money ) before 3 years from now as they were all securities I created with my signature and the bank did n't disclose this to me or pay me. \\nThey filed an assignment of mortgage through MERS to my county ( XXXX XXXX, FL ) public records that has been verified robo signed, fraudulent and was filed after sanctions, regulations, judgments and laws expressly disallowed this type of mortgage assignment. \\nI feel BOA should be required to reimburse or pay me at least 30 % of the profits made from my promissory note, mortgage note regardless of the statute of limitations. They made money from my signature without disclosing it to me and not sharing any of the profit ... time to pay up. \\nThe loan modification papers would have stripped me of most if not all rights, consumer rights and home owner rights. \\nThey are currently trying to get me to accept a new loan modification. The wording is vague and does not state exactly and explicitly that I am or will qualify for a permanent modification and what the new mortgage amount will be as well as monthly amount due. It will be worded again to strip me of all my rights despite having an attorney and the court overseeing it. I feel or allege that BOA will wait a few months after the permanent mod and inform me that I no longer qualify for the mod and they are foreclosing but I wo n't have any legal recourse because of the signed mod contract. My refi was done XXXX XXXX and thus does n't qualify for any of the settlement modifications so I know it will be canceled. \\nAlso note that the refi date was after the bank bail out and sanctions, regulations and laws were put into place that should have prevented them from separating the notes and making significant amounts of money off of me and my notes without my knowledge. \\nI understand that BOA was not held accountable or liable for their practices because of all who were involved and that it is unfair to make the courts deal with these issues and the courts are forced to decide whose toes they have to step on ... which is usually the home owner as they do n't have the money and power the bank does.

When I explained the details of the situation, they did not acknowledge the best effort I made to be current and refused to waive the fees since in their determination it was not a Wells Fargo Error.

I spoke with supervisor \" XXXX \\'\\' who said she would file a payment dispute. She continued to say they would not waive the fee as Wells Fargo did n\\'t make an error. She kept saying they send out statements and that I just need to read them. My main point of frustation and complaint is that I was paying at an accelerated rate and made a best faith attempt to not only be current but pay more than required. What I failed to realize, is even though the account has credit card access they based the minumum payment on 3.5 % of the ORIGINAL balance. My accelerated payments did n\\'t do anything to change the minimum on what I thought was a credit card account. Because I planned out my payment strategy up front, I did n\\'t look at the billing as they came and did n\\'t realize their unusual therefore to a small extent deceptive minimum payment process. When I asked how frequently they get these issues, they would not answer, which makes me think it is fairly common. I sincerely believe there is an ongoing business practice to extract fees from otherwise interest free accounts without regard to customer concern or reasonable waiver policies. They went as far to partially blame current regulatory environment for not allowing discretionary waivers. My hope with this complaint is to get the {$25.00} fee waived if possible, but more importantly to ensure Wells Fargo Financial National Bank is required to have a better complaint program than they seem to. They only took the billing dispute when I made them and did not know about any complaint program. Then to make matters worse the billing dispute can take XXXX days - my balance would have been paid off for over XXXX days by that point. They do n\\'t need 60 days. \\n',\n",

This subsidiary currently manages the mortgage which we are currently holding for the house. Everything seemed to be going well ; we completed all the paperwork and paid the application fee of {$570.00}. Time began to pass and we lost all communication with Popular Mortgage. I sent multiple e-mails inquiring about the loan and only got half answers. Finally in XXXX XXXX, Popular Mortgage informed us that they were denying us the re-finance loan because of a \" wording \\'\\' issue with the title. They argued that XXXX single word in the tittle invalidated the tittle, thus they were not obligated to complete the re-financing action. \\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION : The property in question is located in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, kilometer XXXX, sector XXXX. The house was purchased in XXXX and financed through Popular Mortgage. We have been paying this mortgage for 10 years and not once have we missed a single payment, thus we are in good standing with the bank. Our credit rating is outstanding, and our debt to income ratio is low. Thus, there are no legal justifications that would preclude us from qualifying for the new loan. As a matter of fact, my wife and I just completed a re-finance loan for our current residence on XXXX XXXX, XXXX with XXXX XXXX Bank for the amount of {$280000.00}. \\nThe house was sold by XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. The house was built in XXXX and it included a total of XXXX square meters. Prior to the construction, XXXX XXXX divided the land into XXXX plots : XXXX of XXXX square meters for the main house and XXXX for XXXX square meters that was given to the architect that drew the construction plans for the house. The XXXX, district of XXXX, XXXX XXXX approved the division of land on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. On XXXX XXXX XXXX, my wife and I hired a land investigator that reviewed the records in the XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX XXXX and confirmed that the request for division of land had been submitted officially as follow : VOLUME : XXXX CHAPTER : XXXX TOWN : XXXX PROPERTY : XXXX INSCRIPTION : XXXX page XXXX of the purchase agreement title, the notary wrote the following statement : \" All individuals involved in this land purchase understand that the registry of this land and its current status are in good standing with the law and that under his best knowledge ( notary ) this land title study reflects the current status of the title ownership. \" Popular Mortgage stated on e-mail dated XXXX XXXX XXXX that the registry of the land in which the house was built did not comply with the statutes established by XXXX ( XXXX of XXXX ) and that the \" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' statute has not been met. This argument is irrelevant to the re-finance action, since it refers to a directive to annex the plot of XXXX square meters to the plot of land annexed to it. The plot of land in which the house rests ( XXXX square meters ) is registered legally in XXXX as verified by XXXX XXXX XXXX, title investigator, who was hired by both my wife and I to verify the land registration in question. \\nBOTTOM LINE:1. Popular Mortgage agreed to finance the purchase of the house in question in XXXX with the SAME documentation ( titles, notaries, etc. ) that they now argued to be invalid. \\n2.

So on XXXX/XXXX/2015 I followed her instructions which matched the instructions in the refinance packet, and mailed the remaining documents in the pre-paid postage envelope provided from a Post Office in XXXX, TX.

Even though, it was their instructions and envelope, they do not track the packages in anyway ( nor to the note that information in the refinance package ). This seems ridiculous. Customers are mailing personal and highly confidential information to them from all over the country and they not only do not track the packages they also hinder the consumer from doing so as well. This process is very flawed and I am not sure what the Bureau can do, but I wanted this practice to brought to light. I was informed by a BofA representative, that mail gets lost every day, and there was nothing they ( or I ) could do about it. I was to either resend the forms or lose the refinance.

I looked and this was not noted in any of their instructions. They did supply a fax number but DID NOT state the option of going into a branch. That XXXX simple piece of information could have saved me from the frustration on the entire refinance process.

I informed XXXX that, of course, I had no way of knowing the calls were coming from her and that in any event, I do n\\'t answer calls from XXXX unless a voicemail is left. After informing XXXX not to speak to me in the manner she was speaking to me in, the conversation moved to the issue of the debt I owe to a former apartment complex. The initial balance XXXX provided me with was {$3500.00} and she immediately proceeded to ask me ( in a very rude and unprofessional tone ) how I wanted to pay the debt this month. I told her that I needed to first know what the breakdown of charges were. I feel that prior to asking me for a method of payment after providing me with the balance owed, XXXX should have first given me the breakdown of charges so that I could determine whether I needed to dispute any of them. XXXX seemed to take issue with the fact that I asked her to provide me with the breakdown of charges prior to giving her a method of payment, and she then proceeded to raise her voice and become extremely belligerent as I told her that the balance seemed high given that I should only owe 2 months of rent per the apartment complex \\'s policy ( I had already spoken with the management at the complex ). I attempted to inform XXXX that if she simply provided me with the breakdown of charges, there would be no need to argue because I could then confirm that I was charged in accordance with Texas law. After several attempts, XXXX finally provided me with the breakdown of charges. She then proceeded to rudely attempt to explain to me that the law did n\\'t matter, that she had seen plenty of apartment complexes charge more than what I was being charged and that she had no idea why I was upset since I had obviously been given a break by the complex. I informed XXXX that the reason for my inquiry was not relevant ; the only concern she should have is that I have a right to inquire into the specifics of my debt and the specific reasons behind the charges. XXXX again told me that she had never seen someone argue about being charged less than what they owe and that she did n\\'t understand why I was n\\'t being charged the entire lease amount but that she was going to call the apartment complex and \" find out why. \\'\\' I believed this to be some attempt at a veiled threat and at this point I informed XXXX that she could call the complex if she wished but that the billed amount would likely stand due to Texas \\'s landlords \\' duty to mitigate damages from broken leases.

On XXXX XXXX I had great difficulty ordering a product on-line using my BOA credit card. After several failed attempts to pay with my card I called BOA. They told me that their fraud detection capabilities flagged my card and they would need to validate my attempted purchase before allowing it to go through. I was shocked, since I was actually using BOAs 'ShopSafe ' capability which should clearly indicate to even the most primitive software that it could not be fraudulent activity. Also disturbing, was that after each attempt to authorize payment I would receive an alert on my mobile device indicating a successful payment. After working with customer service we were able to authorize the purchase. I was actually able to see the purchase as a pending transaction on the BOA website. Unfortunately, after nearly XXXX, the pending status never changed, and there was no shipment notification from the merchant. I actually called the merchant inquiring as to why they were not shipping my item. They informed me that they have been trying to finalize the authorization with BOA, but failed each time. On XXXX XXXX I set up a conference call with BOA and the merchant. We tried repeatedly to remove the totally erroneous 'fraud detection block ' but to no avail. During these attempts, the pending status of my earlier attempt disappeared! In the end, I needed to hang up with the BOA associate and complete my purchase with an American Express card. The associate on the phone indicated that because I bought a juice in XXXX during the morning, but was attempting to make a web purchase with a company in Minnesota in the afternoon, I likely caused a fraud alert to lock my card! \\nThere are XXXX upsetting aspects to this : The XXXX is that BOAs credit card software is disjointed, primitive, and functional only if all variables and circumstances are pristine. Even the slightest digression from a normal credit card event ( like an XXXX resident buying a juice in the morning and then using the internet to order an item out of state ) causes their systems to fail. XXXX, none ( none! ) of the other credit cards I own have ever cancelled themselves without notice ( my previous complaint to cfpb ) or blocked my card so thoroughly that even the issuing agency could not unlock it! This indicates that BOA has chosen to allow the client experience to suffer immeasurably rather than absorb unfortunate, but normal losses from credit card fraud. I can not be the only customer being inconvenienced. The thought of being overseas on vacation, or in an emergency situation and dependent on my BOA credit card is now a situation I must mitigate immediately by ending my relationship with BOA. \\n\",\n",

In XXXX XXXX my vehicle was parked outside my home and was rear ended by a XXXX high school girl distracted at the wheel. My vehicle sustained over {$17000.00} in damage and was deemed a total loss. At the time of the accident I carried full coverage insurance through XXXX and also carried Gap insurance coverage. My insurance company paid over {$21000.00} towards the vehicle because the girl at fault was uninsured. The remaining balance of approximately {$850.00} should have been covered by the Gap insurance I paid for monthly. After all deductions made and refunds calculated Ally sent me a statement advising me that I owed the above balance. How is that possible? The entire reason I purchased Gap insurance was to cover additional costs not covered by my personal insurance company. I disputed this with Ally for several months. Ultimately, fighting a losing battle I paid Ally The REMAINING balance they claimed I owed. At which point, ALLY proceeded to report my account as a charge off.

              "       'I graduated from XXXX XXXX in Tennessee in 2010. I messed up my grades and lost some scholarships but continued my degree, financing with student loans, federal and private. After graduating, I discovered that they had been sold across the country and I was ineligible to consolidate them as my \" income did n\\'t meet criteria. \\'\\' I began to pay on the student loans and have had several slight issues that were easily and readily remedied. Then, XXXX of my loan companies, XXXX XXXX, sold all of my loan portfolio that was with them to Navient. My parents, in an attempt to help me pay down my student loans had agreed to pay off my highest interest loan ( a loan with 14.25 % interest, compounded daily ). They made an initial payment to make certain that it would be processed properly, of {$500.00}, on said loan. That payment ( plus my payment for the month ), processed properly and was applied towards the loan which they determined, the XXXX with 14.25 % interest. Here \\'s where things took a turn for the worse. They made another payment of {$8500.00} towards that same loan, making certain to notate that they wished it to go towards the loan at 14.25 % interest. According to their website, it showed that I now owed something near {$400.00} remaining on that loan. I continued to check their website, to verify that it would stay processed properly for almost a week. The first day I did n\\'t check is when that payment ( the second, {$8500.00} payment ) got reallocated towards all of the loans in my portfolio, according to some matrix that no one can explain to me. I did n\\'t catch this until I logged in in XXXX to make a payment. I noted the difference and was on the phone with Navient within the week asking them to reapply the {$8500.00} payment solely to the loan with 14.25 %. Easily done, they assured me, and told me to check back within the week. I checked back, and sure enough, they had reapplied the {$8500.00} payment towards the 14.25 % loan, but now they had taken away the {$500.00} payment and reprocessed it towards all my loans, and the loan, which, when initial payments were made, showed less than {$500.00} left on the principal, now showed over {$1000.00}. Since then, I have talked to numerous associates at Navient and tried to explain the situation to them, and a variety of assurances and civility have been shown me, but nothing has changed in the standing of that loan for all the talking that I do with Navient. They have had my loans for 3 months, and they have been messed up for 3 months.

My account was \"referred\" to Chase\\'s foreclosure department within the same month that the sale closed as a Short Sale.  Months before - Chase had already agreed to the Short Sale and the sale was in process per Chase\\'s agreement.  Per the FTC\\'s website - a short sale and a foreclosure are not to be treated the same.  My loan closed as a short sale, the bank never had or took possess of my home and there was never a XXXX.  So why is Chase allowed to continue to report my Short Sale to all XXXX credit bureaus in a manner that causes them to threat the short sale as a foreclosure for reporting purposes, keeping it on my credit for 7 years and thereby damaging my entire credit rating and holding me hostage from a financial perspective?  I have been reporting this to the CFPB for a year and you\\'ve done nothing to to enforce your own mandates regarding Short sales that are stated on the FTC website.  I\\'ve also spoken to an attorney about taking action against Chase.  My attorney advised me that a case would be a losing proposition given that the CFPB has not demanded or published any regulations requiring the banks and the credit bureaus to properly treat short sales as short sales versus a foreclosure.  So why then do you have the information on the FTC website at all if consumers can not rely on it and the banks and credit bureaus are not Required to adhere to it?  I negotiated a short sale with Chase and the transaction closed in a short sale - I\\'ve submitted volumes of documents to your agency evidencing that and Chase does not disagree that the sale closed as a short sale.  However, despite the fact that Chase agreed to a short sale they still referred my property to foreclosure the same month that the sale was closing and now have been allowed to damage my credit by erroneously reporting a short sale as a foreclosure and the credit bureaus are treating it as such.  Until the CFPB requires the credit bureaus and the banks to follow the standard articulated by the FTC and distinguish between the XXXX, consumers like myself will continue to be held hostage by the banks and unfairly punished for something that did not happen.  The CFPB needs to address its lack of enforcement in this area or stop taking mortgage complaints regarding short sale reporting - this is worse than the banks to have clearly articulated mandates for the banks and credit bureaus to follow and then not enforcing them at the consumers expense - so annoyed and disappointed!',\n",

They gave me XXXX options ... release my property to them if this was my primary mortgage ( which it is n't ) or pay balance in full by moving from my property and selling. I filed complaint with Oregon Dept of Justice and I was advise to get attorney but I do n't have the funds. My severance has run out, I have not found work and I have been denied unemployment because I worked for temp services but did n't continue to work ( which I 'm fighting ). My complain is if JP Morgan/Chase had n't XXXX me around all those months and completed my modification in timely fashion I would n't be in this situation. I 'm lost, am I going to lose my home? I worked hard for as a single mom of XXXX to buy this home for them and they refuse to work further with me. Now that I 'm really in a bigger pinch then I was before bankruptcy they decide it 's a power grab and take my home from me? It took over 19 months to get a modification, how is that fair? My primary loan is good, can they really do this to me? I know Oregon Department of Justice is looking into this but I guess I have no choice but to try and sell my home. I ca n't rent or buy anything at this point due to unemployed so I guess I will just be homeless. Modifications should have been done in timely fashion and it was n't and due to their incompetence, I have to pay the price ... \\n\",\n",
